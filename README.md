### Insights
From the initial analysis, the following insights were observed:
- There are some missing values in the dataset. Further analysis can be done to handle these missing values.
- The dataset contains various numeric columns, and correlations between some of them are noteworthy.
- Boxplots show the distribution and potential outliers in the dataset.
- Based on clustering, some patterns emerge that group similar data points.
- Hierarchical clustering also provides a dendrogram to identify hierarchical relationships.
